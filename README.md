# Mode
The basic explanation of the game is that it is a metroidvania with generic 2d platformer control. You walk and jump and that's it for the basic controls.

As you progress through the game, you unlock modes. So far I have planned and/or implemented 6 modes (names not final):
Mode 1 - Light mode - This mode "turns on" certain platforms.
Mode 2 - Dark mode - This mode "turns off" certain walls.
Mode 3 - Bounce - Bounces you over and over while active. This includes water but the player won't be explicitly told that.
Mode 4 - Name pending - All enemies are turned into a piece of food. When you eat a piece of food, you get a speed boost that stacks. 
However, you are chased by a character (probably someone I make or someone in the public domain) known for eating that food. 
I wanted to do like the teenage mutant ninja turtles and pizza but they are not public domain.
Mode 5 - Swim mode - Allows you to swim in water. Unlocked before bounce mode for puzzle reasons.
Mode 6 - High jump - Basically the Icaros Machine from Cruelty Squad. If you land at the same height or lower than you started, you die.

# Progress/Issues

Every planned mode except for number 4 made 
Death is still unimplemented but that will take 5 minutes to do 
High jump is badly programmed and just takes the velocity.y instead of the position.y but seems to actually work fine as long as the velocity threshold is set correctly.

#Contributing

Since this is my game at the end of the day and I just want this to use as a vcs and so people can maybe learn from my code, all outside contributions have to be cleared by me.
If you have an idea to contribute, join my discord server (linked on my site mastrcheef99.github.io) and write it in the contribution ideas.
I don't want you to waste your time to end up getting rejected so put your ideas there first so I can approve them.

Thanks for reading this!
